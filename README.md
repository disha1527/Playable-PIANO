We’ll keep it simple yet interactive, utilizing HTML to structure the piano keys, CSS to style them, and JavaScript to enable the sound and interaction.
Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of music as we embark on this coding adventure!

HTML :
This HTML code defines the structure of a playable piano interface. It includes a wrapper containing a header and a list of piano keys. The header consists of the title “Playable PIANO” and two columns: one for volume control and the other for toggling key visibility. The piano keys are listed within an unordered list (<ul>) with each key represented as a list item (<li>). Each key has a class specifying its color (white or black) and a data-key attribute indicating the corresponding keyboard key to trigger its sound. The span inside each key displays the corresponding keyboard key letter. The CSS file style.css and JavaScript file script.js are linked for styling and functionality, respectively.

CSS :
This CSS code styles a  piano interface for a web page. It imports the Google font “Poppins” and sets global styles for margins, padding, and font family. The body is centered vertically and horizontally with a background color. The wrapper contains the piano interface elements with padding and a dark background. The header styles a title and controls with flex layout. Volume slider and keys checkbox are styled for appearance and interaction.  Piano keys are styled with different sizes and colors for white and black keys. Media queries adjust styles for smaller screens, hiding certain keys and adjusting sizes for better responsiveness.

JavaScript:
This code sets up a basic  piano interface in a web page. It selects piano keys, a volume slider, and a checkbox for key visibility. It initializes an array for all piano keys and an audio object with a default tune. It defines functions to play tunes, handle volume changes, toggle key visibility, and handle key presses. Event listeners are added to trigger these functions when users interact with the piano keys, volume slider, checkbox, or keyboard. Overall, it creates a simple piano application where users can play tunes, adjust volume, and toggle key visibility.
